Hi! I am a Masters student at Imperial College London, specialising in intigrating LLMs into Robotics for better human-robot interaction and manipulation teaching. 

These are all of my projects listed below, contact me if you have any questions on getting code running or if you are working on something similar! I would be very keen to help as much as I can.
